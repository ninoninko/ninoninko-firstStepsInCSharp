# ninoninko-firstStepsInCSharp
# Good day to all fellow readers!
# The following repository contains a simple project. The project itself is divided into 5 subprojects
# which are all connected by a shared command class. In the project I have used different C# features
# such as: arrays, methods, separate files for my classes, conditional statements and loops.

# Should you have an interest in opening the project, you will only need an IDE with C# support.
# (I have used Visual Studio 2022). Simply download the repository and open it in the program.

# I am open to discuss any feedback I can get on my first project.
